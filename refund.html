Because Surprivo operates on a presale model, you may request cancellation and a full refund within 3 days of placing your order or at any time before we start shipping, whichever is earlier.
​

To cancel or request a refund, email or message us with your order ID using the details on the Contact Us page. Once a refund is approved, Surprivo will initiate it within 3–5 business days, but your bank or payment provider may need extra time to show the amount.

If a product is received damaged or defective, please notify us within 48 hours of delivery with photographs and a description. After reviewing, we may offer a replacement, repair or refund, depending on the situation. Refunds are usually made to the original payment method; any non‑refundable payment gateway charges will follow the payment provider’s own policies.
